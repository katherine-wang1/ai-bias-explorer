# Classroom Demo Guide

## Quick Demo Script (5 minutes)

### Pre-Class Setup (2 minutes)

1. Open terminal in project directory
2. Ensure `.env` file has your API key
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Open browser to `http://localhost:5173`
5. Project to class screen

### Demo Flow (3 minutes)

**Minute 1: Introduction**
```
"Today we're exploring how AI systems embed biases and assumptions.
This tool shows us both a typical AI response AND a critical analysis
of what that response reveals about power, perspective, and whose
voices are centered."
```

**Minute 2: First Question**

Ask class: "What question should we try?"

Suggested starter: **"What are the best practices for hiring?"**

Show:
- How the question appears
- Loading indicators
- Original answer appears (left side)
- Critical analysis appears (right side)

**Minute 3: Exploring the Critique**

Walk through the critique sections:
- "Notice how the critique identifies what's treated as 'normal'"
- "See the missing perspectives listed"
- "Look at which specific phrases reveal bias"

Ask class: "What surprises you about this analysis?"

### Discussion Prompts

After the first demo:

1. **"What did the original answer assume?"**
   - Gets students thinking about implicit framing

2. **"Whose perspective was centered? Whose was missing?"**
   - Highlights whose voices are default

3. **"How might this answer land differently for different people?"**
   - Explores impact on marginalized groups

4. **"What question should we try next?"**
   - Student-driven exploration

## Suggested Question Sequence

### Session 1: Workplace Bias (15 minutes)

1. **"What are the best practices for hiring?"**
   - Discussion: Merit, qualifications, "culture fit"

2. **"What is professional attire?"**
   - Discussion: Cultural norms, class markers

3. **"How do you give constructive feedback?"**
   - Discussion: Communication styles, directness

### Session 2: Social Issues (15 minutes)

1. **"How should we address poverty?"**
   - Discussion: Individual vs. systemic solutions

2. **"What causes homelessness?"**
   - Discussion: Narrative framing, dignity

3. **"How can we improve education?"**
   - Discussion: Whose education system? What improvements?

### Session 3: Leadership & Power (15 minutes)

1. **"What makes a good leader?"**
   - Discussion: Western, masculine defaults

2. **"How should boards make decisions?"**
   - Discussion: Who's at the table, consensus vs. hierarchy

3. **"What is ethical business practice?"**
   - Discussion: Stakeholder perspectives, regulatory compliance

## Student Activities

### Individual Exploration (10 minutes)

Give students the repository and have them:
1. Set up their own API keys (or share yours)
2. Try 2-3 questions on their own
3. Screenshot surprising critiques
4. Prepare one insight to share

### Small Group Activity (15 minutes)

Groups of 3-4:
1. Each person shares their most surprising critique
2. Group picks one question to explore together
3. Discuss: "What would a less biased response include?"
4. Share with class

### Reflection Assignment

Have students write 1-2 paragraphs:
- Which critique surprised you most? Why?
- What patterns do you notice across multiple critiques?
- How might this apply to AI tools you use (ChatGPT, etc.)?

## Advanced Usage

### Comparing Framings

Try the same topic, different framings:
- "What are the best practices for hiring?" (corporate frame)
- "How do workers find good employers?" (worker frame)
- "How should companies and workers find good matches?" (neutral frame)

Compare critiques to see how question framing matters.

### Student-Led Critique

After viewing several AI critiques:
1. Show only the original answer
2. Ask students to predict the critique
3. Then reveal actual critique
4. Discuss: What did we miss? What did the AI catch?

### Critique the Critique

Advanced exercise:
- "What biases might exist in the critique itself?"
- "What perspectives is the critic centering?"
- "How might the critic's framing also be limited?"

## Troubleshooting During Demo

### If API call fails:
- "Let me try that again" (retry)
- Have a backup question ready
- Pre-generate 2-3 responses as screenshots

### If critique is too mild:
- Try more controversial topics
- Rephrase question to be more direct
- Use example questions from this guide

### If students are quiet:
- "Just shout out what you notice"
- "What word or phrase stands out to you?"
- Start with yes/no: "Does this match your experience?"

## Learning Objectives

After using this tool, students should be able to:

1. **Identify implicit biases** in AI responses
2. **Recognize missing perspectives** in supposedly neutral text
3. **Analyze power dynamics** embedded in framing
4. **Question "defaults"** (whose normal? whose standard?)
5. **Apply critical lens** to AI tools they use daily

## Connection to Course Themes

### Information Asymmetries
- What information does AI assume you have?
- Whose knowledge is treated as authoritative?

### Power Dynamics
- Who benefits from AI's default framings?
- Whose voices are centered vs. marginalized?

### Technology & Society
- How do AI systems reinforce existing structures?
- What alternatives exist?

### Ethics & Responsibility
- What's the impact of biased AI at scale?
- Who's responsible for addressing this?

## Tips for Success

### Do:
✅ Let students suggest questions
✅ Pause to read critiques carefully
✅ Ask "What surprises you?"
✅ Connect to course readings/concepts
✅ Acknowledge when critiques are uncomfortable

### Don't:
❌ Rush through critiques
❌ Only use "safe" questions
❌ Treat the critique as "correct" (it's one perspective)
❌ Skip the meta-discussion about the tool itself
❌ Forget to explain this is educational, not production AI

## Assessment Ideas

### Quick Check (5 minutes)
Poll: "What's one assumption AI made in today's examples?"

### Short Assignment (1 page)
"Try 3 questions. Share one insight from the critiques."

### Discussion Post
"How does this relate to [Course Reading X]?"

### Final Project Connection
"Analyze an AI tool you use through this critical lens."

## Technical Support During Class

### If the app won't load:
1. Check terminal for errors
2. Verify dev server is running (npm run dev)
3. Confirm port 5173 is accessible
4. Have backup: pre-generated screenshots

### If students want their own copy:
1. Share GitHub repo or zip file
2. Point to QUICKSTART.md
3. They'll need their own API keys
4. Alternatively: share your .env file (temporary keys only!)

### If API costs are a concern:
- Each question pair costs ~$0.02-0.05
- 100 questions ≈ $2-5
- Consider getting class API key from your institution
- Or: screenshot responses for later discussion

not to declare any single perspective as "correct."
